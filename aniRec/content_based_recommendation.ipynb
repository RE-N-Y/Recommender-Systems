recommendation model\n","\n","From the result above, the content recommendation seems to be working quite well! Kimi ni Todoke is a school-themed highschool romance series and so are the other animes that are being recommended. All of them have school/romance elements and the top recommendation is its sequel which should be a very natural recommendation. However, generalizing on just few results doesn't do justice.\n","\n","### Ideas for improvments\n","1. **Use a hit rate metrics to measure performance of the model:**\n","    Using a hit rate is better than taking the average rating of the items and calculating the error against real rating\n","    because accurate rating does not imply that the user will like that item. Hit rate is better because recommendation is\n","    already in a top-N list format. Or ranking-loss might even work better as a matrix\n","2. **Using other features**: For this model, we only used a few features which we think is important with characteristics of the show. But, perhaps trying out other features may increase its performance as well.\n","3. **Different method for similarity score**: For now, we were just multiplying each similarity matrix to obtain overall similarity\n","Obviously similarity in one feature may be more important than other feature so using each similarity measure as a feature to regression model may help in assigning approperiate weightings to each feature.\n","4. **Better NLP techniques**: As seen in the list of feature names, some of the words still contained character's names which are irrelevant to the plot. Removing these names manually may also help extract better features. Also a lot of them contain numbers which are also irrelevant to the plot."]}]}
